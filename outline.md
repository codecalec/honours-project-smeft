# Applications of Standard Model Effective Field Theory to 2D differential distributions of top pair production
# Alexander Veltman

## Abstract

## Introduction
- Success of standard model
- Still unexplained physics (find examples)
- SM describes data very well (maybe find examples)
    - Z prime search as example
- Brief talk of smeft
    - Note about heavy physics

<!--- talk about tops for smeft-->
<!--- mention simultaneous constraining of operators-->

## Top Physics
- History of top observations
    - inclusive to differential thanks to LHC
- Large mass of top and theoritical consequences
    - coupling to higgs through yakawa
    - higgs loop correction
    - 18.2 Thomson
- Top pair production
    - Include Feynmann diagrams of gluon-gluon, t-channel, quark-antiquark

## LHC and ATLAS
- What is LHC
- what is atlas
- Why tops here?
- Could talk about how top measurements are done ???
- describe data in detail
    - contributions to uncertainty
        - systematic uncertainty dominate
        - statistically limited at extremes
    - mention absolute cross section

## Standard Model Effective field theory
- Outline of smeft
- Recent progress in modelling
    - NLO is new
- Talk relavent top operators
    - Ctg and ctq
