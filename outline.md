# Applications of Standard Model Effective Field Theory to 2D differential distributions of top pair production
# Alexander Veltman

## Abstract

## Introduction
- Success of standard model
- Still unexplained physics (find examples)
- SM describes data very well (maybe find examples)
- Brief talk of smeft
- talk about tops for smeft
- mention simultaneous constraining of operators

## Top Physics
- Unsure on depth ???
- Top pair production
    - Include Feynmann diagrams of gluon-gluon, t-channel, quark-antiquark

## LHC and ATLAS
- Unsure on depth ???
- Could talk about how top measurements are done ???

## Standard Model Effective field theory
- Outline of smeft
- Talk relavent top operators

## dEFT

### Fitting Procedure

## Analysis

### Monte Carlo event generation
#### K-factor determination

### mttbar differential cross sections
#### Model Validation
#### Results

### Multidimensional differential cross sections
#### Model Validation
